# Etch-A-Sketch

Creating Etch-A-Sketch from Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch
In this project, I create a pretty neat toy Etch-A-Sketch to show my skills in DOM manipulation. This project required building a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
For Extra credit in this project, instead of changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse to change it to a completely random RGB value. Then try to have each mouse pass add another 10% black to it so that squares will be completely black after 10 passes.
