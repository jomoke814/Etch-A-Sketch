# Etch-A-Sketch

Creating Etch-A-Sketch from Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch
In this project I create a pretty neat toy Etch-A-Sketch to show my skills in DOM manipulation.
This project require to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
